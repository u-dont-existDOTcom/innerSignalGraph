    "Report the action without requiring the younger state to trust it yet.",
    "Where communication itself is the action, a private draft and caring editor may help preserve truth and the boundary; return to inward care afterward when useful. Do not postpone a necessary protective action to complete an exercise.",

    "The action or its review provides truthful information about what supports protection and follow-through, including when a reasonable plan needs changing."
