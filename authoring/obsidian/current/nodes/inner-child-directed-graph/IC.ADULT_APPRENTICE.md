      "The adult function can become real through ordinary action before it feels like a stable identity.",
      "Review distinguishes accountability and learning from punishment or judgments about worth. Accountability may still include consequences, firmer boundaries, and an honest assessment of present capacity."

  "recommendations": [
    "Name what the helper did, choose five percent to do personally, and test one action in ordinary life.",
    "Gradually hand the role and the judgment behind it back to the person so they become more able to check, disagree, revise, and act without the helper.",
    "Name what capacity the person exercised, what help remained useful, and what the real-world attempt taught them; independence does not require refusing appropriate support. Care includes interest and delight, not duty alone, and should support exploration outside the exercise.",
    "Carry the borrowed function into one ordinary-life act that the person initiates, then review what it actually contributed rather than treating completion alone as success.",
    "Keep outside support available when useful while returning authorship, judgment, disagreement, and revision to the person.",
    "After attempting improved care, protection, or guidance for the inner child, notice without harsh judgment what felt right and what you could do better next time."
  ],
  "successSignals": [
    "One protective or nurturing act occurs without the helper present, and the person can evaluate the helper without needing the helper’s permission.",
    "The person can initiate a small caring/protective act and evaluate whether it helped without handing the helper permanent authority.",
    "The review yields clearer understanding and either one bounded repair or adjustment, or a clear conclusion that no change is needed, without materially escalating self-attack."
