## Proposal rationale

Apply the exact owner-approved wisdom-practice packet record while preserving current safety, relationship, trajectory, consent, provenance and task-state boundaries. The worst plausible failure is a fitting optional practice displacing protection, reality checking, a valid boundary, or current consent.

## Regression intent

The proposal declares G930–G962, including direct entrances, refusal/close boundaries, safety precedence, raw-variable spoofing, outward editor support and relationship-first routing.
